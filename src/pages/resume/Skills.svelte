  <h5>Programming languages</h5>
  <p>
    I am proficient in
    <ToolList tools={proficientLanguages} />.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to these languages, I enjoy learning new languages whenever I
    find one I've not encountered before. I find that learning different
    languages broadens my perspective when tackling problems in popular
    languages. Some such languages are
    <ToolList tools={personalLanguages} />.

    A great place to look for such languages is

      r/ProgrammingLanguages
    </a>, which is a popular forum for language announcements of all kinds.

  <h5>Dev environment</h5>
  <p>
    I currently run
    <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop!_OS 20.10</a>
    (an Ubuntu-based Linux distro) on all of my machines. I use
    <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a>
    as my terminal emulator,
    <a href="http://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a>
    as my text editor, and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux">tmux</a>
    as my session manager/terminal multiplexer. All of my configuration for
    these tools (in addition to everything else I use) can be found in my

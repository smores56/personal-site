          I think that Sudoku needs no explanation. It was fun to implement this
          all by myself, and writing it in TypeScript (which is what this site
          is written in) made my life pretty easy. There are 100 random puzzles
          of varying difficulty, so just hit the "New Game" button and have at
          it!
